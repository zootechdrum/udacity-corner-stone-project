# Movie Casting Agency

## Motivation for project
The motivation behind building this application is to further expand my knowledge in web development technologies. This project gave me the oppertunity to learn about Auth0, python, postman and SQLAlchemy. 

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the python [Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

Virtual Enviorment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the python [docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the /backend directory and running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the ```requirements.txt``` file.
